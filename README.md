### Setting Up the Database

### Steps to Create an RDS PostgreSQL Database

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console.**
2. **Navigate to the RDS Dashboard:**
   - In the AWS Management Console, search for and select RDS to open the RDS Dashboard.
3. **Create a New Database:**
   - Click on Create database.
4. **Choose a Database Creation Method:**
   - Select Standard create for more customization options.
5. **Engine Options:**
   - Under Engine options, select PostgreSQL.
6. **Templates:**
   - Choose the Free tier template to ensure that the instance is eligible for the free tier.
7. **Specify Database Details:**
   - DB Instance Identifier: Enter a unique name for your database instance (e.g., mydatabase).
   - Master Username: Enter the master username (e.g., mydatabaseuser).
   - Master Password: Set and confirm a strong password (e.g., your-password).
   - Initial Database Name: Provide a name for your initial database (e.g., mydatabase).
8. **Connectivity:**
   - VPC: Choose the VPC where your EC2 instance is located.
   - Public Accessibility: Set to Yes if you need to migrate the database from a local environment to RDS. After migration, change it to No to ensure that the RDS instance is not publicly accessible.
9. **Additional Configuration:**
   - Security Groups: Select or create a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 5432 from your EC2 instance’s IP address.
10. **Review and Create:**
    - Review all the settings you’ve configured.
    - Click Create database to launch the RDS instance.

### Connecting EC2 to RDS

1. **Obtain the Endpoint:**
   - Once the RDS instance is created, go to the Databases section in the RDS Dashboard.
   - Select your database instance to view its details and find the Endpoint.
2. **Update EC2 Configuration:**
   - Ensure that your EC2 instance’s security group allows outbound traffic on port 5432.
   - Update your `.env` file on the EC2 instance with the RDS connection details:
     ```plaintext
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host_name]:[port_number]/[database_name]"
     ```
   - Replace `[RDS-endpoint]` with the endpoint URL from the RDS dashboard.
3. **Migrate Data (if needed):**
   - If you set Public Accessibility to Yes, you can connect to the RDS instance from your local environment to migrate data. After migration, set Public Accessibility to No for better security.

### Running the Application

1. **Activate the virtual environment and install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Navigate to the `prisma` directory and run `main.py`:**

    ```bash
    cd ../prisma/
    python3 main.py
    ```

3. **Navigate to the `ml_models` directory and run `ml_main.py`:**

    ```bash
    cd ../ml_models/
    python3 ml_main.py
    ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Setting Up a Reverse Proxy with Caddy

1. **Install Caddy:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install caddy
   ```
2. Configure Caddy for reverse proxy:
   Edit the Caddyfile (/etc/caddy/Caddyfile):

   ```bash
   :80 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
   }


   your-domain.duckdns.org {
      reverse_proxy localhost:3000
   }

   ```

### Setting Up DuckDNS

1. **Create an account and obtain your token:**

   - Go to the DuckDNS website.
   - Create an account and log in.
   - Add your desired domain (e.g., your-domain.duckdns.org) and obtain your token.

2. **Create and configure the DuckDNS update script:**

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/duckdns
   cd ~/duckdns
   vim duck.sh
   ```

   Add the following content to duck.sh:

   ```bash
   echo url="https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=your-domain&token=your-token&ip=" | curl -k -o ~/duckdns/duck.log -K -
   ```

   Replace `your-domain` with your DuckDNS domain and `your-token` with the token you obtained.

   Make the script executable and run it:

   ```bash
   chmod +x duck.sh
   ./duck.sh
   ```

   Set up a cron job to update DuckDNS automatically:

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to the crontab file:

   ```bash
   */5 * * * * ~/duckdns/duck.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   This will run the DuckDNS update script every 5 minutes.

### Setting Up Scheduled Tasks

Open the crontab file:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following lines to schedule the scripts:

```bash
# Run /prisma/main.py every weekday at 15:00
00 15 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/prisma/main.py >/dev/null 2>&1

# Run /ml_models/ml_main.py every weekday at 18:00
00 18 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/project/ml_models/ml_main.py >/dev/null 2>&1
```
